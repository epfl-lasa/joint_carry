# run the right lwr like this:

make sure that you are on the right branch for the kuka-lwr-ros which is "damping_controller"

roslaunch lwr_simple_example real.launch robot_name:=right_lwr robot_world:=right_lwr_base

roslaunch lwr_fri lwr_fri_console.launch robot_name:=right_lwr



you can ssh into ....170 and run from the same terminator

roslaunch lwr_simple_example real.launch robot_name:=left_lwr robot_world:=left_lwr_base

roslaunch lwr_fri lwr_fri_console.launch robot_name:=left_lwr






# test passive ds on the right

rostopic pub /right_lwr/joint_controllers/passive_ds_command_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "linear:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0
angular:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0" -r 100


rostopic pub /right_lwr/joint_controllers/passive_ds_command_orient geometry_msgs/Quaternion "x: 0.0
y: 1.0
z: 0.0
w: 0.0" -r 100


and then change the gains in the reconfigure






## test the old qbhand
it should be powered 12V
Connected to USB 

Then launch the "bringup_qbhands.launch"

rostopic pub --once /right/qb_interface_node/qb_class/hand_ref qb_interface/handRef '{closure:[0.0]}'
rostopic pub --once /left/qb_interface_node/qb_class/hand_ref qb_interface/handRef '{closure:[0.0]}'

If the order is wrong (left vs. right), change the confing files 
'/dev/ttyUSB0' and '/dev/ttyUSB1'



## Vision system
You need to have markers for left and right lwr around each robot base.
They should be called as the following the vision software
right_lwr_markers (for the one closer to the wall)
left_lwr_markers (for the other one)

and markers for the guard (name also: guard)

make sure that all the cooridates are aligned with the mocap/world
